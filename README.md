# E-commerce Shop with Public API

This project is an e-commerce shop built using Node.js, Express, and EJS, incorporating a public API for product data.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn
* nodemon (optional, for development)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-project-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Install nodemon (optional):**

    ```bash
    npm install -g nodemon
    # or
    yarn global add nodemon
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Using nodemon (recommended for development):**

    ```bash
    nodemon app.js
    ```

    This will start the server and automatically restart it whenever you make changes to your code.

2.  **Using Node.js:**

    ```bash
    node app.js
    ```

    This will start the server. You'll need to restart it manually after each code change.

3.  **Access the application:**

    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:<port>` (replace `<port>` with the port number your server is running on, usually 3000).


### Usage

* The application fetches product data from a public API.
* Users can browse products, view product details, and potentially add items to a cart (depending on the project's features).
* EJS templates are used to render dynamic content.
* Static files in the `public` directory provide styling and client-side functionality.

### API Usage

Describe which public API is being used, and how it is implemented.
